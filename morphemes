Morphemes

A morpheme is the smallest unit of speech. In the speech, morphemes play a big role. When you want to identify a morpheme, think of the meaningful word that bases the allomorph. For example, reader. In this allomorph, morpheme has to be the base-word with a meaning. In this case, read. Because read morpheme makes reader allomorph with -er. 

Simply, a word may contain several morphemes. For example, unemployed. This allomorph consists of -un, employ, past tense -ed morphemes. This is just one instance. A word/allomorph can have the following types of morphemes;
Brings out the opposite meaning with -un (unemploy, unpleasant, unarm)
Brings out the past tense with -ed (employed, enjoyed, talked)
Brings out the plural meaning of the morpheme with -s (cats, senses, talks)
Brings out the quality and state of something with -ence (conference, sequence)
Brong out the noun state of a morpheme (performance, remittance, allowance)
Combination of above mentioned types (Unemployed, performances)

Wait, I forgot to mention about allomorphs. When two or more morphemes are used to form a word, its called an “allomorph”.

Apart from the types mentioned above, there can be more. When morphemes are researched and studied further, that field is called “Morphology”.
